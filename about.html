		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Born in Trieste (Italy) the 15th of December 1983, starts playing Cello when 4 years old. After a few year shifting from Cello to Violin and Piano, his mother decides to sign him up to a modern keyboard school in Trieste where he enjoys playng simple rock songs until the age of 11.
		Then he stops playing quite everything until at 16 he decides to buy a guitar, and his adventure begins again.
		<p>He plays guitar in several Rock bands starting with ThgiLdnAkraD at the Filippin College, and then in SoundRise for nearly four years before getting kicked out for "creative" reasons.</p>
		<p>The experience of being kicked out from the band makes him quit playing Guitar and approach his beloved Drums.
		In 2011 he founds with some friends a band called NoLicence and together they record the EP "Feet on the Roof" and the "Give it Up" videoclip.
		After lots of gigs around, the band loses enthusiasm and stops reharsing, so Filippo decides to start a new challenge.</p>
		<p>Now he is a Singing student of Maestro Carlo Urizio, and in the last year his vocal abilities are exponentially increased.
		Happy Days.</p>
